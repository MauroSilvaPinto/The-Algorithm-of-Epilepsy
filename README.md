# The algorithm of Epilepsy: merging theatre with Epilepsy

The algorithm of Epilepsy is an original theatre play about EEG Epilepsy Seizure Prediction.
This play is a collaboration between the Department of Informatics Engineering of the University of Coimbra
and Marionet theatre company (https://marioneteatro.com/en).

The play will be presented to the public if a season of 5 shows in Teatro da Cerca de SÃ£o Bernardo, Coimbra, Portugal, from 28 June until 2 July.

This GitHub presents some creative processes concerning computer simulation, EEG, and complex systems.
Each folder has its readme file to provide more context.

## Inspiration lines
- Ictogenesis: computational simulations on brains with Epilepsy that generate seizures and interictal epileptiform activity;
- Game of Life: computational simulations of the famous John Conway's Game of Life, as a metaphor for neurons in a microscope and life, as a complex system;
- Fireflies: computational simulations of neurons firing and synchronizing as a metaphor for neurons firing in the hippocampus;
- Reading EEG: a classic for all that work with EEG.
