# The algorithm of Epilepsy: merging theatre with Epilepsy
# Fireflies simulations

Code based on cellular automaton.
The brain is represented here by a matrix (you decide its size and shape). Each cell of the matrix is one neuron with two possible states (on or off, 1 or 0).

I was interested in complex systems: complex structures obtained from many individuals, where each follows simple rules.
We have many complex systems in nature, including the rules of Darwin's evolution, the brain, and even computation.

Videos of neurons firing in the hippocampus inspired me. These firing patterns reminded me of fireflies' firing and synchronization patterns.

## How to execute this code

You can execute both codes. Both perform different simulations. 

- [main.py](/Fireflies/main.py) - a code that performs fireflies synchronized activity, inspired by (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGvtnE1Wy6U);
- [random_fireflies.py](/Fireflies/random_fireflies.py) - fireflies randomly firing in a matrix.
