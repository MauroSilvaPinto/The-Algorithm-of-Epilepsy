# The algorithm of Epilepsy: merging theatre with Epilepsy
# Reading the EEG

Code to read the EEG as a video over time.
This way, we can see the beauty and terror of a seizure in a neonatal EEG.


I used the developed code from ktapani github (https://github.com/ktapani/Neonatal_Seizure_Detection) to open the EEG and annotations data from a publicly available dataset (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201939#rightslink).

Then, I developed a code to display the EEG in white lines and a dark background.


## How to execute this code

You execute "live_animation_video.m". The code will read the EEG, display a video and record it as an MP4 file.

## Autorship

All data and files are not mine except "live_animation_video.m".

All data and original code can be found in these two links:

The authors of the codes are Karoliina Tapani (Aalto University, Finland) and Nathan Stevenson (University of Helsinki, Finland and
